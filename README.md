# Hello, nerds

I code on occasion, believe it or not. I also have some non-coding things that I update on occasion, for example my [talks](https://github.com/cassidoo/talks) repo.

I have a [weekly newsletter](https://cassidoo.co/newsletter/) that you should check out! In it I share with you what's new and cool in the world of web development, an interview question of the week, jokes, stories, mechanical keyboards, and mooore. There's a few thousand subscribers and I think you'll like joining them.

I love jokes and musicals. Also candy. If you would like to discuss these things, you can join my [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/cassidoo) (which has an awesome Discord group) or follow me on [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/cassidoo.co) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/cassidoo), or jump over to my [livestream](https://twitch.tv/cassidoo) (which is currently paused from its normal weekly cadence, but we'll be back soon). I typically write [on my personal blog](https://cassidoo.co/blog) if I'm in a bloggy mood. You can also [ask me anything](https://github.com/cassidoo/ama) (within reason).
